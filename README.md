- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DavidMartelC, 
                              My main plan is to become a C# /.net cross-platform mobile developer and maybe do some mobile video games afterwards with unity or another c# engine. For the moment I am learning the language. 

I have experience on javascript for about 1 month but the web I really didn't like so I focus on mobile. 

On my gitHub you will see projects more oriented towards self-practice. I intend to start later in freelance or my own mobile application developer company and maybe games.
